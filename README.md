# IMPLEMENTATION OF D-ALGORITHM USING PYTHON
## ATPG
ATPG stands for Automatic Test Pattern Generation, and it is a crucial process in the field of electronic design automation (EDA) and digital circuit testing. ATPG involves generating a set of test patterns that can be applied to a digital circuit to detect and diagnose faults or defects in the circuit. The primary goal of ATPG is to ensure the reliable and fault-free operation of integrated circuits.

## D-Algorithm
The "D-Algorithm" is a specific Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) algorithm used in the field of digital circuit testing to generate test patterns for detecting and diagnosing faults or defects in digital circuits, particularly in sequential circuits.
